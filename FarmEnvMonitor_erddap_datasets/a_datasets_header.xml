<!-- GENERAL INFORMATION
The information in this file specifies which datasets your ERDDAP will serve.
The initial version of this file has a few examples which should work for you.
But after your initial experiments with ERDDAP, 
you should replace them with information for your datasets.

You can change this document (e.g., add datasets, change metadata) while ERDDAP is running. 
The changes will be detected the next time this document is read
(as often as setup.xml loadDatasetsMinMinutes).

Each dataset has a reloadEveryNMinutes value (default = 10080 (one week)).
When this document is reread, datasets that haven't been been reloaded in 
their reloadEveryNMinutes will be reloaded.
You only need to specify a reloadEveryNMinutes value if you anticipate that
the dataset will change periodically.

If this document has an xml error, processing will stop and an email
will be sent to emailEverythingTo as specified in setup.xml.

If you want to remove a dataset while ERDDAP is running, add 
    active="false"
to the dataset tag.  For example,
    <dataset type="EDDGridFromDap" datasetID="erdMHchla8day" active="false">

<!-- If you want to refuse requests from certain clients
  (e.g., to fend off a Denial of Service attack or an overly zealous web robot), 
  add their numeric IP address (e.g., 123.45.67.89) to this comma-separated list. 
  You can also replace the last number in an IP address with * to block 0-255 (e.g., 123.45.67.*).
  See your ERDDAP daily report for a list/tally of the most active requesters. -->
<requestBlacklist></requestBlacklist>

<!-- Blacklisted IP addresses often have troublesome scripts that make
rapid-fire, repeated, bad requests.
With this setting, you can slow down the response to blacklisted IP addresses 
or other failed requests by some number of milliseconds. 
Recommendations:
* If the trouble is a Distributed Denial Of Service (DDOS) attack from 100+
  attackers, set this to a smaller number (0? 10? 100?).
  Slowing them all down for too long leads to too many waiting threads.
* If the trouble is from 1-10 sources, set this to 1000 ms (the default).
  That slows them down so they waste fewer network resources.
  Also, 1000 ms won't annoy human users who make a bad request.

<slowDownTroubleMillis>1000</slowDownTroubleMillis>

<!-- If you want to prevent specific people from using the email/URL subscription
     system, add their email addresses to this comma-separated list. 
     You can use the name "*" to blacklist an entire domain, e.g., *@example.com .
-->
<subscriptionEmailBlacklist>your.email@yourinstitution.edu, some.name@company.com, 
another.name@company.com, *@example.com</subscriptionEmailBlacklist>

<!-- For security reasons and reasons related to the subscription system, DON'T USE THIS!
Instead, always use the public domain name in the <sourceUrl> tag
and use the /etc/hosts table on your server to convert local domain names 
to IP numbers without using a DNS server. 
(see http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/hosts.5.html)
You can test if a domain name is properly converted into an IP # by using:
  ping some.domain.name

But if you insist:
You can use <convertToPublicSourceUrl> tags to convert the local sourceUrl 
(used in dataset tags) into the public sourceUrl (which appears in a 
dataset's globalAttributes).
This is only needed if some datasets use non-public sourceUrl's
(usually because their computer is in your DMZ or a local LAN). 
'from' and 'to' are the start of the URLs and are case sensitive.
'from' must be '[something]//[something]/' . 
For example,
<convertToPublicSourceUrl from="http://192.168.31.18/" to="http://oceanwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/" />
will cause a matching local sourceUrl (such as http://192.168.31.18/thredds/dodsC/satellite/BA/ssta/5day)
into a public sourceUrl (http://oceanwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/thredds/dodsC/satellite/BA/ssta/5day).
